title: About this blog
---

This blog is a personal project where I explore topics of interest to me and write about them. It has several objectives:
<ol> 
    <li>to display my skills, passion and personal learning journey in Data Science </li>
    <li> to encourage me to investigate topics in depth and structure them into discrete pieces of work where I can write about and reflect on my learnings</li>
    <li> personal enjoyment</li>
</ol>

With that in mind, the topics I intend to cover are simply just things I find interesting at the time.
