# About this blog
This blog is a personal project where I explore topics of interest to me and write about them. I've claimed its probably not nonsense, but it might be more correct to say "hopefully". I'll leave it to you to decide the value of ε. 

This blog has several objectives:
<ol> 
    <li>to display my skills, passion and personal learning journey in Data Science </li>
    <li> to encourage me to investigate topics in depth and structure them into discrete pieces of work where I can write about and reflect on my learnings</li>
    <li> personal enjoyment</li>
</ol>

Each article represents my current state of knowledge. Rather than treating this as an expert disseminating findings, the reader should treat these articles as a record of my own learning and take what they can from them that they find interesting or illuminating. My intent is that this blog is not the output of a completed journey and acquired wisdom but instead a record of the journey and acquisition itself.

# About me
I'm a professional Data Scientist with an academic background covering Philosophy, Economics and Computer Science. My professional experience is similarly varied covering transport modelling, data analytics, online advertising and public policy. With regards to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I'm particularly interested in reinforcement learning, online learning and Bayesian methods. 

I really enjoy having an open ended problem that I can mull over and solve slowly.
