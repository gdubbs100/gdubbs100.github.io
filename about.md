# About this blog
This blog is a personal project where I explore topics of interest to me and write about them. I've claimed its probably not nonsense, but it might be more correct to say "hopefully". I'll leave it to you to decide the value of ε. 

This blog has several objectives:
<ol> 
    <li>to display my skills, passion and personal learning journey in Data Science </li>
    <li> to encourage me to investigate topics in depth and structure them into discrete pieces of work where I can write about and reflect on my learnings</li>
    <li> personal enjoyment</li>
</ol>

Each article represents my current state of knowledge. Rather than treating this as an expert disseminating findings, the reader should treat these articles as a record of my own learning and take what they can from them that they find interesting or illuminating. My intent is that this blog is not the output of a completed journey and acquired wisdom but instead a record of the journey and acquisition itself.

I do, and plan to, use generative AI tools to help me complete projects. However, given that my aims is to promote my own learning, in the majority of cases I write the code and articles myself. By the same token - you can solve math problems with a calculator or use existing libraries to implement a model - but you can often learn much more by learning algebra or writing out implementations yourself. There are times this is feasible, and times it is an obstacle, depending on your objective. As such, when I am trying to learn about algorithms or the inner workings of a technique, I will often be writing them myself (but I may use GenAI as guidance). But in other occassions, when things are simply an intermediary step (e.g. making a nice plot, a simulation environment or a video etc) it is likely that I will use GenAI to unblock that process so I can focus on learning the things I set out to. Of course - I also do this for enjoyment, so where it increases my enjoyment - be it by using or not using GenAI - I will do so. I'm not always going to flag generative AI use unless it is interesting to do so.

# About me
I'm a professional Data Scientist with an academic background covering Philosophy, Economics and Computer Science. My professional experience is similarly varied covering transport modelling, data analytics, online advertising and public policy. With regards to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, I'm particularly interested in Reinforcement Learning, online learning and Bayesian methods. 

I really enjoy having an open ended problem that I can mull over and solve slowly.
